# manpapers
A small collection of wallpapers from images I've taken when I decide to do amateur photography.

- Edited photos will go into the edited folder
- Raw photos will go into the original folder

All images are taken by me. Feel free to edit or use them as you wish! All I ask for is credit, and that you do not try to sell them or something.

This is a small personal project by someone who does take amateur photos in her spare time, don't expect anything grand, just something small and fun aside from coding
