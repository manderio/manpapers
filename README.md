# manpapers
A small collection of wallpapers from images I've taken when I decide to do amateur photography.

- Edited photos will go into the edited folder
- Raw photos will go into the original folder
- Any additional information can be found in the info.md files!

All images are taken by me. Feel free to edit or use them as you wish! All I ask for is credit, and that you do not try to sell them or something.

This is a small personal project by someone who does take amateur photos in her spare time, don't expect anything grand, just something small and fun aside from coding

### Contributing
Want to add to this? Sure! Do this:
- Fork this repo
- Create a folder with your name
- Add the desired images in there, you can structure it however you want, but please do stay with format of splitting up edited/unedited photos, if you want to categorize things under subfolders, please do so!
- Optional, add a textfile/readme with some information or credits

If you only wish to add edits, create your folder in the "edited" folder and add stuff there!

***Please do keep in mind that this project is under an open source license, if you try to submit something where you do not own the images, it won't be merged. Also, do not take credit for something you didn't make. If you made an edit, plesae include links to the original image.***
