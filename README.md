# manpapers
A small collection of wallpapers from images I've taken when I decide to do amateur photography.

- Edited photos will go into the edited folder
- Raw photos will go into the original folder
- Any additional information can be found in the info.md files!

All images in the top level folder are taken by me. Feel free to edit or use them as you wish! All I ask for is credit, and that you do not try to sell them or something.

This is a small personal project by someone who does take amateur photos in her spare time, don't expect anything grand, just something small and fun aside from coding
