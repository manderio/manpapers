## Here are some contribution guidelines!
So you wish to contribute? Amazing! Here are a few guidelines I would like you to follow:

### Before you start, please for the love of god note that
- I will not accept images that you do not own. 
- If you make an edit to someone else's work, they will be the one to review it, not me. 
- All images here are licensed under open source. If you want an image removed, please contact me. 
- I am a human, nothing I say or do is perfect, so is everyone else, treat them as such
- This is a fun project to work on in spare time, treat it as such. 

Start by forking the repo and then, depending on what you wish to do, follow these:

### I would like to add edits to this repo
- You want to do edits to one of the pictures under [origin](original)
  1. Create a new folder in [edited](edited) with your name
  2. Store any edited images in the directory you just created
  3. PR time!
  
- You want to do edits to a picture that does not belong to origin
  1. Go into the directory of the user you wish to edit from and find the original picture
  2. If they don't have an edited folder, feel free to create one, or follow their structure if they have specified something in a README.md
  3. Create a subfolder in the edited folder with your name, follow the same procedure as above
  4. PR time! When you do PR, tag the creator of the original images so that they can review the files
  
### I would like to add new original work to this repo
1. Create a new folder in [the main folder](https://github.com/manderio/manpapers) with your name
2. Structure the folder however you want, if you don't follow the structure I'm using by default, feel free to add a README.md for some guidelines
3. Add the images you want to contribute with
4. PR time!
